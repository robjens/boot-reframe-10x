= boot-reframe-10x

A template for the Clojure build tool https://github.com/boot-clj/boot[boot]
which uses the https://github.com/Day8/re-frame[Day8 re-frame] Reagent
Framework.  Boilerplate code is the (not so) canonical TODO MVC example for
re-frame, only having re-frame 10x event tracing setup.

## Usage

```sh
boot -d boot/new new -t boot-reframe-10x -n my.example.spa
```

Then enter the directory created and issue

```sh
boot dev
```

Finally navigate to http://127.0.0.1:3000/public/index.html page on bleep!
