= boot-reframe-10x

A template for the Clojure build tool https://github.com/boot-clj/boot[boot]
which uses the https://github.com/Day8/re-frame[Day8 re-frame] Reagent
Framework.  Boilerplate code is the (not so) canonical TODO MVC example for
re-frame, only having re-frame 10x event tracing setup.

== Usage

[source,sh]
----
boot -d boot/new new -t boot-reframe-10x -n my.example.spa
----

Then change the current working directory to the one created and issue the command:

[source,sh]
----
boot dev
----

This part will likely take a minute or two. On the beep! (compilation of
ClojureScript finished) navigate to: http://127.0.0.1:3000/public/index.html to
see the SPA working.

IMPORTANT: This template uses a few explicit dependency versions and will
likely break when changed without regarding their compatibility. Using
"RELEASE" in these cases will almost guarantee breaking one or more parts of
this solution.
